loading_phrase = The song is about having a heavy dependance on TV, almost like it was a drug. Originally the outro verse went "No puedo seguir masturbándome (I can't keep on masturbating)", which y'know, the label wasn't very thrilled about, so they had them change it to "maquinándome", but the line was brought back occasionally on live performances.
