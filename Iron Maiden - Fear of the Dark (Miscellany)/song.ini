loading_phrase = "Fear of the Dark" is a song about a man who's walking in a park at night, and as it's getting darker, he sees all sorts of worrying things. He becomes totally paranoid because his imagination is working overtime. It's the whole concept of nyctophobia, and by extension, whatever hides in darkness.
