loading_phrase = Soda Stereo's self titled debut was released on the 27th of August, 1984, featuring a style that both mocked and mimicked the "fun music" trend of Argentina at the time, with very sarcastic and tounge-in-cheek lyrics and a very noticeable inspiration in acts like "The Police" and "Men at Work". The album would become a big hit in clubs, eventually becoming a quadruple platinum in its home country, and also selling very well in Peru and Chile. Production was handled by Federico Moura, frontman of another very popular band of the time, "Virus".
