loading_phrase = <i>"Drain You"</i> is a very straight-forward song about dorky love, with Kurt's weird imagery sprinkled throughout. It quickly became a live staple and a fan favorite. Some random toys, including a rubber duck that later appeared in the back cover of <i>"Incesticide"</i>, were used to make sounds in the bridge.
